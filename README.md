# tictactoe
This is a coding challenge to build a “computer player” which is able to play tic-tac-toe on a board varying from 3×3 to 10×10 in size. In order to win, the player has to put either “X” or “O” on any horizontal, vertical or diagonal line across the entire board. 

I have designed a gaming strategy in which a "score" will be calculated for each empty space depending on the number of "X"s and "O"s along the same horizontal/vertical/diagonal line, and the "computer player" will pick the space with the higest score.
